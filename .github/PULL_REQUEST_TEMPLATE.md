# Pull Request Template

This repository uses a single canonical pull request template located at:

`templates/github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`

Please refer to that file for the full set of sections and checklist items to complete when opening a pull request.

> Note: This file exists only to satisfy GitHub's default PR template lookup.
> The canonical template should be edited **only** in `templates/github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
